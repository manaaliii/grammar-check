Hello! I'm Manali!
This is my project on correcting grammar!
 - to run this project, open terminal and type command: "streamlit run <path to your main.py file>"
 - moreover, install packages gingerit and streamlit
 - and if you recieve JSONDecodeError then, in gingerit.py remove session = requests.Session() and add session = cloudscraper.create_scraper() there(also import    cloudscraper)
 
That's it! Enjoy!
